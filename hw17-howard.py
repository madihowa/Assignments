(Problem 1)
In the function rot_approach1, implement â€˜Approach 1â€™ for image rotation as described in the accompanying PDF.
This function already has code which prepares an object res for holding the resulting image.
It creates an object with the same dimensions as the original image but with all pixels preset to black.

    # to fit within an image of the same dimensions.
