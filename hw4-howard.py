Use an input statement with a prompt, asking the user to enter a positive integer N. This integer N will be used for each of the remaining problems.

---------- Problem 3 ------------------
Then use a while loop to calculate
sum from j=1 to N of 1/j^2
and print the result.
    (1) - In PDF
    (2) - If you already know the n-1 value you can easily find the n value by calculating the last term (nth) and adding it to the n-1 value.
    (3) - If we have N=3 then we start with j=1 and calculate that 1/1^2=1 and then with j=2 we calculate that 1/2^2=0.25. Add 1+0.25 giving us 1.25. With j=3 we calculate 1/3^2 = 1/9=.111111. Add that to 1.25 giving us 1.361111111.

Ignore this:    We will use a while loop going through integers up to a predetermined value for N (like we did in problem 1). We can then define a sort of counter variable, j, in which we add 1 to go to the next term in the sequence (i.e., j= 1,j= 2,j= 3,j= 4,...). We will need to calcualte the value for 1/j^2 for as many terms until j=N using the while loop. After every calculation we will add that value to the former term through another variable, n, that is initially set to 0 before the loop.

---------- Problem 4 ------------------
Use a while loop to calculate and print n! (n factorial) for all integers n in the interval [1,N].

    (1) - In PDF
    (2) - If you already know (n âˆ’ 1)! then you can just multiply whatever n is by the n-1 calculation.
    (3) - If we want to find 5! then we start with the lowest integer, 1, and multiply that by the next lowest until we get to 5: 1*2*3*4*5
