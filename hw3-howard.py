-----------------------Problem 1----------------------
Choose a value of c > 0 and compute the first 5 terms in the sequence defined above by hand (with the assistance of a calculator, if necessary). 
Type this example, including a summary of the arithmetic for each calculation, in the comments of your code.
------>Please see the pdf for the answer.

------------------------Problem 2----------------------------
Write code to do the following:
• input a floating point number c from the user. The input statement should include
a prompt asking the user to “Please input a positive real number c:”.
• Calculate and print out the first 10 terms,x1,x2,...,x10,of the sequence defined above,
using the value of c that the user enters.
